Hello World,

My name is Justin (He/Him).

An actuary by training, I had noticed I was most useful streamlining and automating things I was doing often.
Insight in hand, it was clear my career deserved an adjustment.

I studied web development at www.LaunchSchool.com, a marvelous community where mastery is the focus.
Currently, I am a Software Engineer at IQVIA, working on a dockerized Ruby + EmberJS/ReactJS stack.

In my spare time I build Commander decks for the Magic: the Gathering card game.
Of course, I have written a program to assist myself.

I am excited by the thought of finding a place where every day holds new models to be made, puzzles to be solved, and code to be shipped.
If you have a project that might make use of my assistance, or just want to shoot the breeze, I can be reached at JSimpson523@gmail.com.
